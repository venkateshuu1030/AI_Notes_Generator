1. ABSTRACT:    
The AI Notes Generator is a web-based application designed to automatically generate concise and meaningful notes from large textual content. The system uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to summarize input text, reducing manual effort and saving time for students and educators.

2. INTRODUCTION:
With the rapid growth of digital content, students often face difficulty in creating short notes from lengthy study material. The AI Notes Generator solves this problem by using AI-based summarization techniques to produce clear and readable notes automatically.
